### Assume that you were assigned to implement the calculation of ratio and distribution of different items in a defined area.

#### 1. Define the Data Model:
Determine the data structure that represents items and their properties (e.g., name, quantity, category).
Create Java classes to model these items, and consider using JPA (Java Persistence API) if you plan to store data in a database.

#### 2. Data Input:
Implement a mechanism for inputting data about items in the defined area. This could be through manual entry, file uploads, or API endpoints.
In a Spring Boot application, you can create RESTful APIs using Spring Web to accept and handle data input.

#### 3. Data Storage:
If necessary, persist the data in a database. Spring Boot makes it easy to set up data repositories using Spring Data JPA.

#### 4. Data Calculation:
Implement the logic to calculate ratios and distribution based on the properties of the items in the defined area.
You may need to define specific rules for calculating ratios and distribution. For example, you could calculate the ratio of items in each category or the distribution of items based on their quantity.

#### 5. Reporting:
Provide a way to view or export the calculated ratios and distribution results. This could be a web-based dashboard, API endpoints for retrieval, or generated reports.

#### 6. Testing:
Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the accuracy of your calculations.

#### 7. Error Handling and Validation:
Implement error handling to manage cases where invalid or incomplete data is provided.
Validate input data to ensure it meets the expected format and constraints.

#### 8. Security:
If handling sensitive data, implement appropriate security measures, such as authentication and authorization, to protect the data and APIs.

#### 9. Documentation:
Document your code, APIs, and any specific calculations or rules used in the project.

#### 10. Deployment:
- Deploy your Spring Boot application to a suitable server or cloud platform.
